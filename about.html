                AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney 
                in 1973 by Scottish-born brothers Malcolm and Angus 
                Young. Although their music has been variously described 
                as hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal, the band 
                themselves call it simply "rock and roll". AC/DC underwent 
                several line-up changes before releasing their first album, 
                1975's High Voltage. Membership subsequently stabilised 
                around the Young brothers, singer Bon Scott, drummer Phil 
                Rudd, and bassist Mark Evans. Evans was fired from the band
                in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who has appeared 
                on every AC/DC album since 1978's Powerage. In February 
                1980, Scott died of acute alcohol poisoning after a night 
                of heavy drinking. The group considered disbanding but 
                elected to stay together, bringing in longtime Geordie 
                vocalist Brian Johnson as Scott's replacement. Later that 
                year, the band released their first album with Johnson, 
                Back in Black, which was dedicated to Scott's memory. The 
                album launched AC/DC to new heights of success and became 
                one of the best selling albums of all time.

                The band's eighth studio album, For Those About to Rock We 
                Salute You (1981), was their first album to reach number one 
                in the United States. Prior the release of 1983's Flick of the 
                Switch, drummer Rudd left the band and was replaced by Simon 
                Wright, being in turn replaced by Chris Slade in 1989. The band 
                experienced a commercial resurgence in the early nineties with 
                the release of 1990's The Razors Edge. Rudd returned to the band 
                in 1994, replacing Slade and appearing on the band's next four 
                albums. Their fifteenth studio album Black Ice was the 
                second-highest-selling album of 2008, and their biggest chart 
                hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 worldwide.
